    <h3 class="script">Scripting</h3>
    <p class="script"><strong>Units</strong></p><p class="script">So, we're doing a read for ${daysDifference} days, in that time you used a total of ${mrConsumptionInput} Kilowatt Hours or "units". 
    With our Gas Unit rate of €${unitRate}c and the carbon tax per unit of €${carbonTaxRate}c this means you spent €${unitsTotal} on your gas in this period. </p>
    
    <p class="script"><strong>Standing Charges</strong></p>
    <p class="script">
    In addition to this there is
    a standing charge, this is a charge applied by GNI to all gas customers in Ireland and it's charged at a rate of €${standingChargeRate}c per day. There
    is also a prepay service charge of €${prepayServiceChargeRate} per day so your combined daily charges are €${dailyChargeRate} per day which would be
    €${standingChargeTotal.toFixed(2)} in total for this time period.</p>
    <p class="script"><strong>Standing Charge Dispute</strong></p>
    <p class="script">
    Standing charges are applied to all gas customers in Ireland by GNI and go towards maintaining the network. They are applied by all suppliers, both prepay and billpay. The prepay service charge is applied
    by all prepay suppliers and goes towards the service we provide. Standing charges are charged daily so even if you are not using your gas you still need to pay the standing charge. If your meter runs out of 
    credit the standing charge will be taken off future top ups at a rate of 55% towards gas and 45% towards paying off any standing charge debt you have accrued. So you will always get a minimum of 55% of your top 
    ups towards your gas.
    </p>

    <p class="script"><strong>National Average</strong></p>
    <p class="script">Now we can actually compare this to the average customer's uage. The average household in Ireland will use ${nationalAverageUnitsYearly} which on our rates would be €1902.03
        kwh of Gas per year according to the CRU. Bear in mind that people would usually use significantly more gas in
        winter and we would usually see very low gas usage in the summer, or even some poeple would turn their gas off
        for sevearl months. So the daily cost would be €${nationalAverageSpendDaily.toFixed(2)}c per day but to get this average you may use
        approximately €${(nationalAverageSpendDaily * 2).toFixed(2)}c  per day in the winter and none in the summer.</p>
    
    <p class="script"><strong>Comparison</strong></p>
     <p class="script">So if we take this average figures we can see that in the same time period the average customer would use ${nationalAverageUnitsDaily.toFixed(2)}
        Units per day which would cost them €${(nationalAverageUnitsDaily * (unitRate + carbonTaxRate)).toFixed(2)}c for their Gas and pay €${dailyChargeRate.toFixed(2)}c in the combined daily charges for a total of €${nationalAverageSpendDaily.toFixed(2)}c. 
        So comparing yourself to them 
        ${nationalAverageSpendDaily < totalSpend / daysDifference ? `you're €${((totalSpend/daysDifference)-nationalAverageSpendDaily).toFixed(2)}c per day above the average` : `you're €${(nationalAverageSpendDaily-((totalSpend/daysDifference))).toFixed(2)}c per day below the average`}.</p>
